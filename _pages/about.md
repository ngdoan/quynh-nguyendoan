# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Sociology with Demography Specialization at the [University of Texas at Austin](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/sociology/graduate-program/). I completed my undergraduate studies in Economics at [Haverford College](https://www.haverford.edu/economics/academic-programs), and a pre-doctoral Economics program wth the American Economics Association at [Howard University](https://www.aeaweb.org/about-aea/committees/aeasp). Previously, I worked at as a research assistant at Claremont McKenna College, University of Pennsylvania and Analysis Group.

My research focuses on inequality and demography, with a particular focus on how structural factors—such as legal status, healthcare access and educational opportunities—shape mobility for immigrant, undocumented, and mixed-status families in the United States. Influenced by my own upbringing, I am especially interested in how parental undocumented status affects mobility for U.S.-born children.
